\subsection{Finite Element Discretization}
As seen on \nameref{fem_definition}, the finite element discretization reads:
\begin{gather}
	a(u_h, v_h) = (f, v_h)_{0, \Omega} \quad \forall v_h \in V_h.
\end{gather}

\subsection{FEM Convergence on Uniform Meshes}

Through the analysis of this problem, we'll stick to the two cases in which $\alpha = 5/3, 10$.
