\subsection{Finite Element Discretization}
As seen on \nameref{fem_definition}, the finite element discretization reads:
\begin{gather}
	a(u_h, v_h) = (f, v_h)_{0, \Omega} \quad \forall v_h \in V_h.
\end{gather}

\subsection{FEM Convergence on Uniform Meshes}

Given what we've said on \nameref{sob_regularity}, and by the following corollary to the \textit{Deny-Lions' Lemma}:

\begin{theorem}[Deny-Lions corollary]
	Let $u, u_h$ be the solution respectively to the weak formulation of a Poisson problem and its associated order k Lagrangian FEM with shape-regular and quasi-uniform mesh $T_h$. Let $u \in H^s(\Omega)$ for $s \ge 0$, then:
	\begin{gather}
		|u - u_h|_{1, \Omega} \lesssim (\max_{K \in T_h} h_K)^{p}|u|_{s+1, \Omega},
	\end{gather}
	with $p = \min(s, k)$.
\end{theorem}
